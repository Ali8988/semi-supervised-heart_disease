Learning for Heart Disease Prediction
Data : converted from (.txt) to (.csv)

Visual Exploration:
Utilize visualizations to explore relationships between clinical features, such as cholesterol levels, age, and blood pressure, impacting heart disease risk.

Insight Generation:
Analyze data to provide actionable insights into factors that contribute to heart disease, aiding in early detection and prevention.

Data Sources:
The dataset comprises clinical records from various sources, including:
Heart Disease Clinical Data: A CSV file containing features relevant to heart disease diagnosis.

Methods:

Data Loading:
Utilize Pandas to read the CSV file into a manageable DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data by handling missing values and standardizing numerical variables for optimal model performance.
Label Management:
Implement a strategy to mask labels, ensuring a balanced representation of labeled and unlabeled data.
Model Training:
Use semi-supervised learning algorithms, including Label Spreading, Label Propagation, and SVM to train the models.
Model Evaluation:
Assess model performance using classification metrics and visualize results with confusion matrices.

Process Steps:

Data Preparation: Load the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis through preprocessing and label management.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
Model Development: Train semi-supervised learning models to predict heart disease using both labeled and unlabeled data.
